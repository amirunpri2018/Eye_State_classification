# Eye_State_classification
We developed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based ensemble approach to leverage the efficiency of various models together. We have proposed three deep neural network architecture based models: Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Each model can make some errors, and they are complementary in working together.
